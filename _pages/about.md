## üßë‚Äçüíª About Me

Hi! I'm a third-year Master's student at the School of Electronic Engineering, **Xidian University**, supervised by Prof. Mingzhe Zhu. I also received my bachelor's degree from **Xidian University**.  
My research interests lie in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and its applications in remote sensing, with a focus on interpretable deep learning and image understanding.  

From May 2024 to February 2025, I joined the Time-Frequency Signal Analysis (TFSA) group at **University of Montenegro** as a visiting researcher, under the supervision of [Prof. Ljubisa Stankoviƒá](https://tfsa.ucg.ac.me/ljubisa.html). During this exchange, I focused on compressive sensing theory and interpretable machine learning for advanced signal and image processing tasks.
